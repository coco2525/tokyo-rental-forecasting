# Tokyo Rental Rate Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project, developed in Summer 2024, predicts rental rates for residential properties along Tokyoâ€™s Odakyu Line using machine learning. The model analyzes property features like proximity to train stations, building age, and square footage to provide actionable insights for renters, investors, and property managers.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Scraped data from 776 rental properties across 52 pages using `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Removed irrelevant features and handled missing values.
  - Created new variables, including building age and dummy variables for room types.
- **Visualization**:
  - Rental trends and correlations visualized using bar graphs, box plots, and heatmaps.
- **Model Development**:
  - A linear regression model achieved an RÂ² of 0.85.
- **Web Deployment**:
  - User-friendly prediction app deployed via Flask on PythonAnywhere.

## Data and Methods

### Data Source
- Data scraped from [Real Estate Japan](https://realestate.co.jp/en/rent).

### Preprocessing
- Filtered properties along the Odakyu Line.
- Added dummy variables for categorical data and standardized numerical features.

### Visualization
- **Trends**:
  - Rental properties distribution by station.
- **Relationships**:
  - Rent vs. distance to the nearest station.
